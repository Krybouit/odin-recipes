    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>¾ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>   
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin tins or line cups with paper liners.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk stout beer, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until<br>
            evenly blended. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in<br>
            sour cream. Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking soda in a<br>
            separate bowl. Gradually mix the flour mixture ingredients into the beer mixture.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Spoon cupcake batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes are risen and set in the middle but still soft and tender, about 25 minutes.<br>
            Cool in the tins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Whisk cocoa powder and stout beer together in a bowl. Beat in butter and cream cheese using an electric mixer until well combined.<br>
                Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until frosting has desired sweetness.<br>
                Spread or pipe frosting onto cooked cupcakes.</li>
     </ol>
